# Mobile App Development - SUSPENDED

## Status: SUSPENDED (August 5, 2025)

### Reason for Suspension
Development of the React Native mobile app has been suspended due to persistent technical issues with the Expo development environment:

- Expo tunnel connections are unstable and require constant restarts
- QR code rescanning needed repeatedly during development
- Development workflow is impractical and frustrating
- User decision to prioritize web platform stability

### What Was Accomplished
- ✅ Basic React Native project structure created
- ✅ Authentication context and API service implemented
- ✅ Login screen with ANETI branding created
- ✅ Navigation structure with 5 tabs planned
- ✅ Loading spinner component created
- ⚠️ Authentication issues identified but not resolved

### Technical Issues Encountered
1. **Expo Tunnel Instability**: Frequent disconnections requiring restart
2. **Session Management**: Mobile apps don't handle HTTP cookies like browsers
3. **Development Environment**: Constant need to rescan QR codes
4. **API Communication**: Authentication flow not working correctly

### Recommendation
Focus development resources on:
1. **Web Platform Stability**: Ensure web app is fully functional
2. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Consider PWA features for mobile-like experience
3. **Responsive Design**: Optimize web app for mobile browsers
4. **Future Mobile Development**: Revisit when more stable mobile development tools are available

### Files Preserved
All mobile development files are preserved in the `/mobile` directory for future reference:
- App.js - Main app structure
- src/context/AuthContext.tsx - Authentication logic
- src/services/ApiService.ts - API communication
- src/screens/ - Login and main screens
- src/components/ - Reusable components

## Decision: Focus on Web Platform Excellence
